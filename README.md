GO is a compiled language and it is compiled into machine code which is platform independent.
GO is simple and speedy.

Local Setup to write GO
1. Install GO compiler - GO distribution comes with GO CLI tool
2. Install an IDE - VisualStudioCode or Intellij
   
Variable and Constants :
1. In GO if we declare a variable or import a package, GO compiler gives error stating variable/package defined but not used. Good reminder to clean up code.
2. Constant values cannot be changed throughout the code.

Data Types : 
1. string, int, Booleans, Maps, Arrays
2. Go is a statically typed language
3. You need to tell Go Compiler, the data type while declaring the variable, if you do not assign the value immediately.
4. Type Inference : But, Go can infer the type when you assign a value.

Pointers in GO
1. saves address of variable.
